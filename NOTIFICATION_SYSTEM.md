# Match Notification System

## Overview

The site now has **two separate notification systems** for match updates:

1. **Voice Announcements** - AI-generated text-to-speech announcements
2. **Smart Notifications** - Hybrid system that adapts to page visibility

Both systems can be enabled/disabled independently for each match.

## Features

### Voice Announcements

- Uses OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo to generate natural language announcements
- Text-to-speech with premium English voices at 0.85 speed (slower for clarity)
- Automatically disabled for finished matches
- Toggle with volume icon (üîä/üîá) on match cards

### Smart Notifications (Hybrid System)

The notification system intelligently adapts based on whether you're actively viewing the page:

#### When Page is Visible (Foreground)
- **In-App Toast Notifications** - Material-UI Snackbar
- Displayed in the top-right corner
- Auto-dismiss after 5 seconds
- Different colors for different event types:
  - **Success** (green) - Match ended
  - **Info** (blue) - All other updates
- Non-intrusive and visually integrated

#### When Page is Hidden (Background)
- **Native OS Notifications** - HTML5 browser notifications
- Appear at the system level (Windows/macOS notification center)
- Work even when browser is minimized or you're using other apps
- Click notification to focus browser window
- **Requires user permission** - Browser will ask on first use

This ensures you always see notifications in the most appropriate way!

## Announcement Types

Both systems announce 5 types of match events:

1. **Match Start** - When a match begins
2. **Game Won** - When a game is won (every game)
3. **Set Won** - When a set is completed
4. **Tiebreak Point** - During tiebreak points
5. **Match End** - When the match finishes (winner's score first)

## Toggle Controls

Each match card has two independent toggle buttons:

| Icon | System | States |
|------|--------|--------|
| üîä VolumeUp | Voice Announcements | Enabled |
| üîá VolumeOff | Voice Announcements | Disabled |
| üîî NotificationsActive | Visual Notifications | Enabled |
| üîï NotificationsOff | Visual Notifications | Disabled |

## Player Names

- Uses **full player names** (e.g., "Juan Mart√≠n D√≠az")
- Removes ranking numbers from names (e.g., "(8)" is stripped)
- Announces both team members separated by "and"

## Score Formatting

Match end announcements always show the **winner's score first**:

**Example:**
- If Team B wins 6-4, 6-4, the announcement is:
  - ‚úÖ "Team B wins the match 6-4, 6-4"
  - ‚ùå NOT "Team B wins 4-6, 4-6"

## Technical Implementation

### Files

- **src/api/announcement.service.js** - OpenAI integration and speech synthesis
- **src/contexts/AnnouncementContext.jsx** - State management for both systems and native notifications
- **src/components/MatchCard.jsx** - Match card with dual toggle buttons

### Browser Permissions

Native notifications require user permission:

```javascript
// Permission is requested automatically when user first enables notifications
if (Notification.permission === 'default') {
    await Notification.requestPermission();
}
```

### Native Notification Features

- **Tag-based** - Prevents duplicate notifications for the same match
- **Auto-close** - Dismisses after 5 seconds
- **Click handler** - Focuses browser window when clicked
- **Icon/Badge** - Uses site favicon for branding
- **Silent option** - Can be configured to be silent or play system sound

### Environment Variables

Required in `.env` files:

```
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

### Dependencies

```json
{
  "openai": "^4.x.x"
}
```

**Note:** Native notifications use the browser's built-in Notification API - no additional dependencies required.

## State Management

The `AnnouncementContext` tracks:

- **voiceSubscriptions** - Set of match IDs with voice enabled
- **notificationSubscriptions** - Set of match IDs with notifications enabled
- **lastAnnouncedStates** - Last known state of each match
- **notificationPermission** - Current browser notification permission status

## Notification Permission States

1. **default** - User hasn't been asked yet (will prompt on first toggle)
2. **granted** - User allowed notifications (notifications will show)
3. **denied** - User blocked notifications (shows alert to enable in settings)

## Auto-disable Logic

Voice announcements are **automatically disabled** when a match finishes to prevent repeated announcements.

Visual notifications continue to work for finished matches (user can manually disable).

## How It Works

1. User toggles notification for a match
2. Browser requests permission (if not already granted)
3. Context adds match ID to subscriptions
4. Auto-refresh polls for match updates
5. When a change is detected:
   - **Voice**: Generates AI announcement ‚Üí Speaks via Web Speech API
   - **Notification (Page Visible)**: Generates AI message ‚Üí Shows in-app toast
   - **Notification (Page Hidden)**: Generates AI message ‚Üí Shows native OS notification
6. Notifications auto-close after 5 seconds
7. Click native notification to focus browser window

### Visibility Detection

The system uses `document.hidden` and `document.visibilityState` to detect if the page is in the foreground or background:

```javascript
const isPageHidden = document.hidden || document.visibilityState === 'hidden';
// If hidden ‚Üí Native OS notification
// If visible ‚Üí In-app toast notification
```

## Usage Example

**User wants both voice and notifications:**
1. Click üîä icon ‚Üí Voice enabled
2. Click üîî icon ‚Üí Browser asks for permission ‚Üí Notifications enabled
3. Match updates trigger both systems
4. **While viewing the page**: See in-app toast notifications
5. **While in another app**: Receive native OS notifications

**Testing notifications:**
1. Enable notifications on a match
2. Keep the page open ‚Üí See toast notifications
3. Minimize browser or switch to another app ‚Üí Receive OS notifications
4. Click OS notification ‚Üí Browser window comes to focus

## Usage Example

**User wants both voice and notifications:**
1. Click üîä icon ‚Üí Voice enabled
2. Click üîî icon ‚Üí Browser asks for permission ‚Üí Notifications enabled
3. Match updates trigger both systems

**User wants only notifications (silent):**
1. Keep üîá icon (voice disabled)
2. Click üîî icon ‚Üí Browser asks for permission ‚Üí Notifications enabled
3. Match updates show only OS notifications

**User wants only voice:**
1. Click üîä icon ‚Üí Voice enabled
2. Keep üîï icon (notifications disabled)
3. Match updates are spoken but no OS notifications

## Browser Compatibility

Native notifications work in:
- ‚úÖ Chrome/Edge (Desktop & Mobile)
- ‚úÖ Firefox (Desktop & Mobile)
- ‚úÖ Safari (Desktop & Mobile with iOS 16.4+)
- ‚úÖ Opera (Desktop)

**Note:** Some browsers may require HTTPS for notifications to work (localhost is exempt).

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

- Notification sound effects (in addition to voice)
- Customizable auto-close duration
- Notification history panel
- Batch notifications for multiple matches
- Persistent user preferences (localStorage)

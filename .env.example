# FOR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT:
# Copy this file to .env.development and add your actual API key
#   cp .env.example .env.development
#

# GitHub Actions injects VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY from repository secrets
# If deploying elsewhere, create .env.production locally with:
#   VITE_BASE_PATH=/site-padely/
#   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_production_api_key

# Base path for the application
# Use '/' for root deployment (e.g., https://example.com/)
# Use '/subdirectory/' for subdirectory deployment (e.g., https://example.com/subdirectory/)
VITE_BASE_PATH=/

# OpenAI API Key for match announcements
# Get your API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Announcement Feature - Latest Updates

## Changes Made (October 10, 2025)

### 1. ✅ Read Full Player Names (Not Just Last Names)

**Issue:** The system was only reading the last name of players (e.g., "Galan / Chingotto")

**Solution:** Updated `getTeamNames()` to use the complete player name.

**Before:**
```
"Galan / Chingotto lead 3 games to 2"
```

**After:**
```
"Agustin Galan / Federico Chingotto lead 3 games to 2"
```

**Code Change:**
```javascript
// Before: Only last names
const player1 = player1Name.split(' ').pop(); // Get last name

// After: Full names
return player2Name ? `${player1Name} / ${player2Name}` : player1Name;
```

---

### 2. ✅ Slower Speech Rate for Better Clarity

**Issue:** The speech was too fast and hard to understand.

**Solution:** Reduced speech rate from 1.0 to 0.85.

**Code Change:**
```javascript
// Before
utterance.rate = 1.0;

// After
utterance.rate = 0.85; // Slower rate for better clarity
```

**Result:** More natural, easier-to-understand announcements.

### 3. ✅ Auto-Disable After Announcing Finished Match

**Issue:** When clicking the bell on a finished match, it would stay enabled even though there are no more updates.

**Solution:** The system now announces the final score and immediately stays disabled.

**Behavior:**

**Before:**
1. User clicks bell on finished match ✅
2. Announcement: "Galan / Chingotto win the match by 6-4 6-3" 🔊
3. Bell stays enabled (blue) 🔔 ← Unnecessary

**After:**
1. User clicks bell on finished match ✅
2. Announcement: "Agustin Galan / Federico Chingotto win the match by 6-4 6-3" 🔊
3. Bell stays disabled (gray) 🔕 ← Correct!

**Code Logic:**
```javascript
if (newEnabled) {
    const matchEnded = await handleInitialAnnouncement(match);
    
    if (matchEnded) {
        // Don't enable announcements for finished matches
        // Just announce and return without enabling
        return;
    }
}
```

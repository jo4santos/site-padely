## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Python 3 (for serving production build)

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the Vite dev server with hot module replacement:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

### Production Build

Build the app for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates optimized static files in the `dist/` folder.

### Serving Production Build

Serve the production build with the included Python server:

```bash
python3 serve-dist.py
```

Or use any static file server:

```bash
# Using Python's built-in server (requires SPA routing support)
python3 -m http.server 8080 -d dist

# Using npx serve
npx serve dist -p 8080

# Using any other static host (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, etc.)
```

**Important:** For React Router to work properly, your server must:
- Serve `index.html` for all routes that don't match static files
- The included `serve-dist.py` handles this automatically

## Key Features Implementation

### Auto-Refresh

Tournament detail pages automatically refresh match data every 5 seconds when enabled (default: ON). This provides near real-time updates for live matches.

### Smart Updates

The app uses React's efficient re-rendering to update only changed elements:
- Match scores
- Current game points
- Winner status
- Live badges

No manual DOM manipulation needed - React handles it efficiently!

### Match Statistics

Click any match to view detailed statistics:
- Overall match stats
- Set-by-set breakdown
- Serve stats (aces, double faults, etc.)
- Return stats
- Visual comparison bars

### Tournament Categories

Tournaments are automatically categorized:
- **Live Today**: Tournaments happening right now
- **Upcoming**: Future tournaments
- **Past**: Completed tournaments (shown with reduced opacity)

### Filters

- **Type filter**: Filter by tournament type (Premier, P1, P2, etc.)
- **Gender filter**: Filter matches by Men/Women categories
- **Search**: Search tournaments by name

## API Integration

The app uses the Padely API at `http://fredericosilva.net:8081/padely` with a CORS proxy for local development.

Endpoints used:
- `GET /padely/events` - List tournaments
- `GET /padely/event?id={id}&day={day}` - Get matches
- `GET /padely/match_stats?eventId={id}&matchId={id}` - Get match statistics
- `GET /padely/ranking?gender={gender}` - Get player rankings

## Deployment

The production build is completely static. You can deploy the `dist/` folder to:

- **Netlify**: `netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist`
- **Vercel**: `vercel --prod`
- **GitHub Pages**: Copy `dist/` contents to your gh-pages branch
- **Any static host**: Upload the `dist/` folder

All of these platforms handle SPA routing automatically.

## Migration History

This app has evolved through multiple iterations:

### v1 → v2: Vanilla JS to React + Vite
✅ Migrated from vanilla JavaScript to React
✅ Added Vite for build tooling
✅ Implemented React Router for navigation
✅ Maintained all original features

### v2 → v3: React + CSS to React + Material-UI
✅ Migrated to Material-UI component library
✅ Replaced custom CSS with MUI's sx prop and theme
✅ Fixed tabs and match stats bugs
✅ Enhanced UI with Material Design components
✅ Added icons and better visual feedback
✅ Improved responsiveness and accessibility

# Match End Score - Winner First Update

## Change Summary

Updated the match end announcement to always show the **winner's score first** in each set.

## How It Works Now

### Before
If Team B won with scores: 4-6, 4-6
- Announcement: "Team B win the match by 4-6 4-6" ❌ (confusing - shows loser's score first)

### After
If Team B won with scores: 4-6, 4-6
- Announcement: "Team B win the match by 6-4 6-4" ✅ (clear - shows winner's score first)

## Examples

### Example 1: Team 1 Wins
**Match Data:**
- Team 1: set1=6, set2=4, set3=7, isWinner=true
- Team 2: set1=4, set2=6, set3=5, isWinner=false

**Announcement:**
> "Team A win the match by 6-4 4-6 7-5"

### Example 2: Team 2 Wins
**Match Data:**
- Team 1: set1=4, set2=4, isWinner=false
- Team 2: set1=6, set2=6, isWinner=true

**Announcement:**
> "Team B win the match by 6-4 6-4"
(Not "4-6 4-6" which would be confusing)

### Example 3: Three Set Match (Team 2 Wins)
**Match Data:**
- Team 1: set1=6, set2=3, set3=5, isWinner=false
- Team 2: set1=4, set2=6, set3=7, isWinner=true

**Announcement:**
> "Team B win the match by 4-6 6-3 7-5"

## Logic

The system now:
1. Determines which team won
2. For each set, puts the winner's score first
3. Builds the final score string with winner's perspective
4. Generates announcement with winner + winner's score

## Code Changes

### Updated Functions
- `generateMatchEndPrompt()` - AI prompt generation
- `getFallbackAnnouncement()` - MATCH_END case

### Implementation
```javascript
const isTeam1Winner = match.team1.isWinner;

// Put winner's score first in each set
if (isTeam1Winner) {
    sets.push(`${team1Score}-${team2Score}`);
} else {
    sets.push(`${team2Score}-${team1Score}`);
}
```

## Benefits

✅ **Clarity** - Winner's score always first (sports convention)
